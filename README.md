```# University Attendance & Analytics System

A simple command-line tool that helps instructors record student attendance and identify students who may need academic support.

---

## 📌 Overview

In many educational environments, attendance is still recorded manually, which makes it hard to track patterns or notice early warning signs.

This project provides a simple and reliable way to:
- Register students
- Record attendance for each lecture
- Analyze attendance trends
- Identify students with low attendance

The goal is not automation for its own sake, but **better educational support through data**.

---

## 🧠 What the System Does

- Stores students and lectures in a small local database
- Records attendance per lecture
- Prevents duplicate attendance records
- Calculates attendance percentages
- Flags students who may be at risk due to low attendance

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Ethics

- No biometric data is collected
- No location tracking
- No facial recognition
- Only basic identifiers are stored

The system is designed to respect student privacy while still being useful for educators.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- SQLite
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

---

# ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python Attendance-project.py

```
##⚠️ Limitations

Attendance is recorded for the most recently started lecture

Designed as a small educational project, not a full university system

🌱 Future Improvements
